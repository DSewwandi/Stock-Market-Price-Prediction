# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
This project demonstrates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for predicting stock market prices based on historical data. It focuses on capturing time-series patterns to forecast future stock values, providing a foundation for financial analysis and algorithmic trading applications.

The model was built as part of a coursework assignment in Neural Networks and Deep Learning, applying advanced deep learning techniques to real-time stock price movements.

# Technologies & Tools
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations)

Yahoo Finance (data source)


# Key Features
Real-time stock data fetching using yfinance

Data normalization and sequence generation for time-series modeling

Implementation of RNN-based models including:

Simple RNN

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

MLP (as baseline for comparison)

Model evaluation using RMSE and loss curves

Interactive UI built with Streamlit for model selection and prediction

Visual comparison of actual vs. predicted stock prices

# Use Case:
Designed for investors, researchers, and students interested in financial forecasting. The project showcases how deep learning models can identify trends and make predictions in dynamic and volatile markets.
